## RESEARCH

### Subsurface Imaging Technology Based on Microscopes                         Sept. 2020 – Jun. 2021

*Advisor: Dr. Xidong Ding*

•	Formulated the pointer, sample, and buried particle system model using the finite element tool in COMSOL. Participated in the simulation of such Equipotential Lines of the Sample and 2D Scanning Electrostatic Force Distribution Map.

•	Conducted imaging scans of an IC chip in multiple microscope types such as AFM, KPFM, and SCM made by NSK Ltd. Japan and Bruker. The results show that the burial depth and dielectric constant of particles with different physical properties buried in the semiconductor sample can be obtained through multiple scanning and analysis of electrostatic force microscopy, which provides a new method for the non-destructive testing of semiconductor materials and devices.

•	Responsible for the data extraction and analysis in the COMSOL simulation process.

•	Attended 2020 Surface Analysis Technology Seminar, and the third author of the poster Finite Element Analysis Based on Electrostatic Force Microscopy Subsurface Imaging Technology which won the outstanding poster award of this conference.

### Hardware Design Based on the Remote Alarm System                           Nov. 2018 – Jun. 2020

*Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Project of School of Physics; Chinese National Patent; Advisor: Dr. Guocong Lin and Dr. Xidong Ding.*

•	Designed the schematic and the PCB of the hardware circuit. 

•	Programmed the firmware of ESP8266 to realize multiple functions such as the active/passive alarming.

•	Realized the bidirectional transmission between the Alarm System and the self-designed mobile app.

•	Built a prototype of this system which matched the productized standard and has sold several products online.

### Intelligent Hardware and Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) Technology             Feb.2019 – Mar. 2019

*UAV Winter Camp at Soochow University; Advisor: Dr. Zhenghao Lu*

•	Completed the PCB and the CPU-based circuit designs for the motor drive system of the UAV;

•	Produced the PCB circuit and conducted the functional tests;

•	Welded the whole circuit, assembled the UAV, and took the trial flight. 

### Control Circuit Welding for Control Devices of Laser Pattern                Sept. 2018 – Feb. 2019

*Electronic Technology Lab of SYSU*

•	Analyzed the circuits and suggested halving the LM324N amount while maintaining the same circuit performance;

•	Welded various circuits and assembled them; 

## INTERNSHIP 

### Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, Zhongshan Workstation            July 2019 – Aug. 2019

*Hosted by Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Advisor: Dr. Zhonghua Qin*

•	Took electrical performance tests over photomultipler tubes (PMT) after voltage dividing circuit being welded; 

•	Processed reams of data and calculated many performance indexes such as Quantum Efficiency, Photon Detection Efficiency, Gain and P/V of SPE, etc. with LabVIEW;

•	Modified the operational manual and precautions about PMT detection;
